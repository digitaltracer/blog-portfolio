# Event-Driven Architecture with Apache Kafka

Event-driven architecture enables loosely coupled, scalable systems. Apache Kafka provides a robust platform for implementing these patterns.

## Core Concepts

### Events vs Messages
Events represent something that happened, while messages are instructions for action.

### Topics and Partitions
Organize events into topics, with partitions enabling parallel processing.

### Producers and Consumers
Decouple event generation from processing through the pub/sub pattern.

## Implementation Patterns

### Event Sourcing
Store all changes as a sequence of events, enabling powerful audit trails and temporal queries.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Separate read and write models for optimal performance and scalability.

### Saga Pattern
Manage distributed transactions through choreographed events.

## Error Handling Strategies

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer, KafkaProducer
import json
import logging

def process_event_with_retry(event, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            # Process the event
            return handle_event(event)
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                # Send to dead letter queue
                send_to_dlq(event, str(e))
            else:
                # Exponential backoff
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
```

## Best Practices

- **Idempotency**: Ensure events can be safely processed multiple times
- **Schema Evolution**: Plan for backward-compatible message formats
- **Monitoring**: Track consumer lag and processing metrics
- **Partitioning Strategy**: Choose partition keys carefully for balanced load

Event-driven architecture with Kafka enables building systems that are resilient, scalable, and maintainable.
