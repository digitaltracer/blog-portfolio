# The Art of Code Review: Best Practices for Backend Teams

Code reviews are one of the most effective ways to maintain code quality and share knowledge across your team. Here's how to do them right.

## Review Process Guidelines

### 1. Review Early and Often
Don't wait for massive pull requests. Smaller, frequent reviews are more effective.

### 2. Focus on the Important Things
- Logic errors and bugs
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance implications
- Code maintainability

### 3. Be Constructive, Not Critical
Frame feedback as questions or suggestions rather than demands.

## What to Look For

### Security Concerns
- Input validation
- Authentication and authorization
- SQL injection prevention
- Sensitive data handling

### Performance Issues
- N+1 query problems
- Inefficient algorithms
- Memory leaks
- Blocking operations

### Code Quality
- Readability and clarity
- Proper error handling
- Test coverage
- Documentation

## Review Tools and Techniques

Use your platform's review tools effectively:
- GitHub: Line comments, suggestions, review requests
- GitLab: Merge request approvals, discussion threads
- Bitbucket: Inline comments, task creation

## Building a Review Culture

Effective code reviews require team buy-in and clear expectations. Establish guidelines that work for your team's workflow and stick to them consistently.
