# Optimizing Database Performance in Distributed Systems

Database performance is critical in distributed systems where multiple services need fast, reliable data access. Let's explore key optimization strategies.

## Indexing Strategies

### B-Tree Indexes
The foundation of most database performance optimizations.

### Composite Indexes
Carefully designed multi-column indexes can dramatically improve query performance.

## Partitioning Techniques

### Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding)
Distribute data across multiple database instances based on a partition key.

### Vertical Partitioning
Split tables by columns to reduce I/O for specific access patterns.

## Caching Layers

- **Redis**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- **CDN**: Geographic distribution of static content
- **Application-level**: Strategic caching in your service layer

## Query Optimization

```sql
-- Before: Full table scan
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 12345;

-- After: Index-optimized query
SELECT order_id, total, created_at 
FROM orders 
WHERE customer_id = 12345 
AND created_at >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

Performance optimization is an iterative process requiring careful monitoring and testing.
